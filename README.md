# BlazorGE
BlazorGameEngine - hence BlazorGE, basic experimentation with a game engine/framework using Blazor.

This is just a fun project to experiment with Blazor and simple gamne design, highly influenced by David Guida's Blazor 
game development series https://www.davidguida.net/blazor-and-2d-game-development-part-1-intro/ and bits of 
Monogame https://www.monogame.net/ and Monogame.Extended https://www.monogameextended.net/ 

The goal is just to have some fun and play with Blazor really, feel free to fork or submit pull requests etc...
