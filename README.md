# BlazorGE

Blazor Game Engine - hence BlazorGE, is a basic experimentation with a game engine (or more like a framework really) using Blazor. Currently we're
going for something simple but modern, starting with 2D style stuff first - maybe might add some 3D stuff later. Trying to use standard design patterns 
and use dependency injection (where appropriate).

This is just a fun project to experiment with Blazor and simple game design. Highly influenced by David Guida's Blazor 
game development series https://www.davidguida.net/blazor-and-2d-game-development-part-1-intro/ and bits of 
Monogame https://www.monogame.net/ and Monogame.Extended https://www.monogameextended.net/ 

Feel free to fork or submit pull requests etc...

Features (implemented or planned):-

1) ECS - Entity Component System design
2) Asset loading
3) Sprites
4) Easy to use
5) Keyboard and mouse input, maybe touch eventually
6) Game screens (e.g. title, main game play etc...)
7) Basic canvas implementation
8) Several simple example games implementing all features
9) Any other suggestions? :-)
