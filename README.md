# BlazorGE
BlazorGameEngine - hence BlazorGE, basic experimentation with a game engine/framework using Blazor.

This is just a fun project to experiment with Blazor and simple game design. Highly influenced by David Guida's Blazor 
game development series https://www.davidguida.net/blazor-and-2d-game-development-part-1-intro/ and bits of 
Monogame https://www.monogame.net/ and Monogame.Extended https://www.monogameextended.net/ 

The goal is just to have some fun and play with Blazor and simple games really, feel free to fork or submit pull requests etc... As of
21/06/2021 this project is unfinished and still in development, it is in no way fully usable or complete ;-)
